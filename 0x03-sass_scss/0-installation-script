To install and use Sass in your project, first run npm install -D sass to add it as a development dependency. Then, open your package.json file and inside the "scripts" section, add a script like "sass": "sass --watch src/scss:src/css", which tells Sass to watch your src/scss/ folder and compile the .scss files into the src/css/ folder. Once thatâ€™s set, you can simply run npm run sass in your terminal to start the watcher and automatically compile your styles whenever you make changes.
